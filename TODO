- Handle things like "$-10"
- docs.rs documentation
- Allow saving of state
  - use serde_json by implementing serialize on State
  - Don't save all_bytes
    - prompt when unsaved_changes
    - warn in help text that the actual bytes aren't saved 
      in the state
      - *maybe* offer to save the actual bytes, too
