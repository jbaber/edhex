- Handle things like "$-10"
- docs.rs documentation
- Implement printing only a screenful at a time (real ed doesn't bother to do this)
- Save preferences as distinct from saving state
  - Load from preferences in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/edhex/preferences if they exist
  - Give CLI a flag for alternative location for preferences file
- Give CLI flag for a state file.
- When a line isn't complete, the chars come too early.  Fix this.
